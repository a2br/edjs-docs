description: Browse EcoleDirecte's private API with the module of your dreams.

# edjs-docs

`ecoledirecte.js` is a neat node module that lets you interact with the EcoleDirecte private API in a snap. Its goal is not only to make API calls easier but also to take the mess of the ED API and simplify it before giving it to you. The raw data is still always available.

It is built with TypeScript, and all the EcoleDirecte API responses are hard-typed, so everything you do is covered by your IntelliSense and the power of TypeScript.
